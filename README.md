------------------------------------

Not too much in this implementation currently, but you can
exit and enter the vehicle provided for you on screen.

Press WASD to move around, and the mouse cursor to point in
the direction you want to move.

Press F to exit and re-enter the ship. (There is a 1 second delay
between exiting and re-entering a ship).
