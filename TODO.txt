TODO ~~~

- "Small" things
	> Clean up player file
	>> Remove unnecessary things in .h, lines in .cpp
	>> Transformable, position vector, sprite position
	>> This fix will also aid in fixing hit boxes
	> COMMENTS
	> Change player's collision box to ship's when in ship
	>> Give Entity or Turret a "Target" Entity to try to attack
	>>> Also decides behavior - if no target, idle
	> Make projectiles/collisions less resource intensive

- UI

- Inventory
	> different ship types
	> input from command line, spawn at your coords
	> make function to spawn at specific coords
	> add basic UI functionality
	> have ship selection screen, spawns at specific coords
	> select loadout at spawn

- Map
	? Write map to file and load in, or just hardcode map in code
		> Loading requires writing code to both read and write
			maps from text, but opens the door up for a level 
			creation program.
		> Hardcoding is quicker, but not as flexible or easy to 
			make maps with
	> Test out Trigger functionality
	> Have basic interactions - zooming when in hangar, doors open

- Combat
	> When triggered (or Player nearby... even possibly make it
		check if the player is seen with angleBetween method), have
		turret turn towards the player, follow similar to how the 
		Player follows the mouse
	> Begin shooting at player
	> We gots combat now yo
