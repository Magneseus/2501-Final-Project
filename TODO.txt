SPLIT UP GAMEOBJECT AND ENTITY

- Inventory
	> different ship types
	> input from command line, spawn at your coords
	> make function to spawn at specific coords
	> add basic UI functionality
	> have ship selection screen, spawns at specific coords

- Tidy up
	> Clean up player file
	>> Remove unnecessary things in .h, lines in .cpp
	> Give AnimatedSprite a sprite sheet
	> Give Vehicle an AnimatedSprite
	> Fix problem of having so many coordinate types
	>> Transformable, position vector, sprite position
	>> This fix will also aid in fixing hit boxes
	> COMMENTS
	> Fix ship updating things
	> Change player's collision box to ship's when in ship

- Map
	? Write map to file and load in, or just hardcode map in code
		> Loading requires writing code to both read and write
			maps from text, but opens the door up for a level 
			creation program.
		> Hardcoding is quicker, but not as flexible or easy to 
			make maps with
	> Test out Trigger functionality
	> Have basic interactions - zooming when in hangar, doors open

- Combat
	> Create projectiles
	>> Entity, delete self on collision
	> Have player shoot projectiles out towards mouse
	? Hit scan vs Projectiles
	? Different projectiles, Faster/Stronger etc
	> Add getFireRate(), getDamage() to Vehicle and Player/Entity
	> Create turrets/defenses class
	> Follow same turning as player, possibly move code from Player
		to Entity, letting all moving entities turn the same way!
	> When triggered (or Player nearby... even possibly make it
		check if the player is seen with angleBetween method), have
		turret turn towards the player, follow similar to how the 
		Player follows the mouse
	> Begin shooting at player, using getFireRate() (IN ENTITY!!)
	> Add health to Entity
	> Destroy/Delete Entity on <=0 health
	>> call onDestroy() ?
	> Have projectiles damage Entity on collision
	> Create Weapon class:
	>> fireRate, damage, icon (texture for bullet)
	> Add Weapon to Entity and Vehicle (Vehicle is Entity...)
	> getFireRate(), getDamage() changed to return either the
		Entity's value, or Vehicle's value based on veh==NULL
	> We gots combat now yo
